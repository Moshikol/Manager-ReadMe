# Manager ReadMe:
## Welcome!
Hi! Welcome to the team, I'm very happy to have you here, and I'm sure we will build amazing things together.
You are now starting a new chapter in your career in our company,
this is the time for you to take a listen, write things down, **ask any question** that comes to your mind and get to know the team and company.

## Why Readme?
I believe every complex piece of code should be properly documented, so it would be easier to understand and maintain. Humans are even more complex than any piece of code you can find, so why not have documentation to help people interact with each other better?
This is my documentation for you :).

## About me
I'm Moshiko 27yo, I'm T1D since I was 11yo,
I started my SW career at the Israeli ministry of defense, where I served as a software developer for couple of years.  
Then I joined a company called DreaMed Diabetes, I started there as a junior SW developer and worked my way up to be a software team leader.
I'm an off-road driver, motor lover, and an amateur photographer.

### My Role
My Role is divided into three sections:

1.	**People role** - As a manager, my role is to make the team (and you :)) move faster and efficiently.
I will be here to mentor, and help you grow and develop your talent.
As a part of my role, I will provide you context on your tasks and I will be your point of contact to anything (good or bad) you want to share with the management team.
2.	**Tech role** - It is my responsibility to make sure we are building an amazing, scalable, and maintainable product. As part of this responsibility, I would make sure your code is developed according to company standarts to code conventions and business requirements. I will be here to answer any tech/architecture questions you may have.
3.	**Product role** - As a part of being a manager my job is to understand the company product and add clarify buisness context whenever needed.  
That would allow you to design and implement better suited solutions for the task.

### What are my expectations?
- **End to End Ownership** - well, buckle up because we're in this together! As we take on new tasks, I expect you to go full throttle with end-to-end ownership. That means getting the whole picture, from the nitty-gritty tech details to the overarching product goals. You never know what solutions or issues might pop up along the way, so it's crucial to stay on top of everything. Plus, when we're all on the same page, we can build an amazing product that our customers will love.
- **Be A Team Player** - let's face it, programming can be tough. Bugs and conflicts are inevitable. But when things get bumpy, I need you to remember that we're all in the same boat. We're a team, and we're here to steer our ship to the best possible destination. No finger-pointing, no blame games. Just teamwork and collaboration.
- **Boy\Girl Scout Rule** - Speaking of collaboration, have you heard of the Boy/Girl Scout Rule? It's one of my favorites, and I think it's pretty darn cool. Basically, it means that when the Boy/Girl Scouts leave a camping site, they make sure it's cleaner than when they arrived. And I believe the same should go for our codebase. Whenever you tackle a task, aim to leave the codebase cleaner than when you found it. It's a small step, but it adds up and helps keep our codebase shipshape.
- **Continuous Improvement** - Finally, let's talk about continuous improvement. This is a value that's near and dear to my heart. I truly believe that we should always be striving to be better, both as individuals and as a team. So, whether you have feedback, suggestions, or comments, please don't hesitate to share them with me or any other team members. We're all in this together, and we're all committed to making our team the best it can be.

### Personal quirks
- **I'm a passionate arguer** - When I'm invested in something, I can get fired up and maybe even a little loud. It's not my favorite thing about myself, but I'm working on it! I care deeply about doing things well and making sure everyone's voice is heard. If I ever get carried away, please don't hesitate to let me know. I promise it's not my intention to make anyone uncomfortable.
- **I'm a goldfish when it comes to memory** - Seriously, my memory and attention span are about as long as a goldfish's! That's why I'm constantly taking notes. If you catch me typing while we're talking, don't worry - I'm not zoning out or checking social media. I'm just trying to capture every important detail so I can go back and process it later. It may not be the most glamorous system, but it works for me!

### 1:1s
1:1s are **your** meetings. This is your place to talk about anything that's bothering you or you want to share.
Those meetings won't be about status updates, we would talk about your career goals and how we can help you achieve them.
For us to be productive in our 1:1s, I would like you to be prepared: prepare questions, suggestions, initiativs, thoughts, feedbacks, or any other agenda.
But don't worry, if you won't, I will navigate the conversation :).

### **Good luck!**
